# Data-Science with Python Project

In this project, we will analyse the Red Wine Data and try to understand which variables are responsible for the quality of the wine. 
First we will try to get a feel of the variables on their own and then we will try to find out the correlation between them and the Wine Quality with other factors thrown in. 
We will implement Data Science with python to get the results and come out with some understanding.

The data set is related to different attributes of red wine. 
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests) 
1 - fixed acidity                       2 - volatile acidity 
3 - citric acid                         4 - residual sugar 
5 - chlorides                           6 - free sulfur dioxide 
7 - total sulfur dioxide                8 - density 
9 - pH                                  10 - sulphates 
11 - alcohol 

Output variable (based on sensory data) 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
